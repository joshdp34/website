I am a Senior Lecturer in the Department of Statistical Science at Baylor University. My academic interests are in Statistics Education, Sports Analytics, and Machine Learning, areas where I seek to blend theory with practical application. As a proud alum of Baylor University, I embrace the opportunity to contribute to the academic community that shaped my journey. My faith is central to who I am, and I strive to live out my commitment as a follower of Jesus Christ in all aspects of my life. Outside of academia, I cherish the time I spend with my wife and three sons.
